NAME
    Mail::Box::IMAP4::SSL - handle IMAP4 folders with SSL

VERSION
    This documentation describes version 0.01.

INHERITANCE
         Mail::Box::IMAP4::SSL
           is a Mail::Box::IMAP4
           is a Mail::Box::Net
           is a Mail::Box
           is a Mail::Reporter

SYNOPSIS
         use Mail::Box::IMAP4::SSL;
         my $folder = new Mail::Box::IMAP4::SSL(
             username => 'johndoe',
             password => 'x_marks_the_spot',
             server_name => 'imap.example.com',
         );

DESCRIPTION
    This is a thin subclass of Mail::Box::IMAP4 to provide IMAP over SSL
    (aka IMAPS). It hides the complexity of setting up Mail::Box::IMAP4 with
    IO::Socket::SSL, Mail::IMAPClient and Mail::Transport::IMAP4.

    In all other respects, it resembles Mail::Box::IMAP4. See that module
    for documentation.

METHODS
  "Mail::Box::IMAP4::SSL->new( %options )"
         my $folder = new Mail::Box::IMAP4::SSL(
             username => 'johndoe',
             password => 'x_marks_the_spot',
             server_name => 'imap.example.com',
             %other_options
         );

    The "username", "password" and "server_name" options arguments are
    required. The "server_port" option is automatically set to the standard
    IMAPS port 993, but can be changed if needed. See Mail::Box::IMAP4 for
    additional options.

    Note: It is an error to provide a "transporter" options, as this class
    exists only to create an SSL-secured "transporter" for
    "Mail::Box::IMAP4".
